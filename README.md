# Evaluation_Of_Cardiac_Function

## **Overview**
Diagnostic ultrasound imaging is an important tool for evaluating the size, shape, composition, and motion of internal soft tissues and structures. This code was developed to gain exposure to the clinical applications of echocardiography and techniques for evaluating cardiovascular function.

Please see attached respective IEEE  conference paper for an in-depth explanation on various cardiac evaluation techniques and analysis in Matlab.
